## What are Real-World Assets (RWAs)?

Real-world assets (RWAs) in blockchain are digital tokens that represent physical and traditional financial assets, such as currencies, commodities, equities, and bonds.

## What are Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs)?

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are blockchain-based digital tokens that represent physical and traditional financial assets, such as cash, commodities, equities, bonds, credit, artwork, and intellectual property.

## Tokenizing Real-World Assets

Tokenizing real-world assets involves representing the ownership rights of assets as onchain tokens. In this process, a digital representation of the underlying asset is created, enabling onchain management of the assetâ€™s ownership rights and helping to bridge the gap between physical and digital assets. 

## Benefits of Tokenized Assets

- `Liquidity`: Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) can make traditionally illiquid assets more easily tradable. 
- `Transparency`: Since the tokenized assets are represented onchain, transparency and auditable asset management are ensured.
- `Accessibility`: Tokenized RWAs can broaden the potential user base of certain asset types.

## How To Tokenize Real-World Assets

The high-level process of tokenizing a real-world-asset involves several steps.

- `Asset selection`: Determining the real-world asset to be tokenized.

- `Token specifications`: Determining the type of token (fungible or non-fungible), the token standard to be used (like ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155), and other fundamental aspects of the token.

- `Blockchain selection`: Choosing the public or private blockchain network on which to issue the tokens. Integrating Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) helps make the tokenized RWA available on any blockchain.

- `Offchain connection`: Most tokenized assets require high-quality offchain data from secure and reliable oracle services. Using a trusted verification mechanism to confirm the assets backing the RWA tokens is essential for maintaining user transparency. This typically involves a reputable service like Chainlink.

- `Issuance`: Deploying the smart contracts on the chosen network, minting the tokens, and making them available for usage.

## Deploy RealEstateToken.sol to Avalanche Fuji

Make sure to turn the `Solidity compiler optimizer on` to `200 runs` and `set `EVM version` to `Paris`.

Add the following in `DEPLOY` configuration section in `Remix`:

- `URI_`: ""
